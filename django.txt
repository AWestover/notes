heroku can host django

also can be done locally

django is the back end

html is still front end

note you CAN also use a data base service

recomended postgresql
sudo apt install postgresql-client-common

this stuff will get you into the virtual env
sudo pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pipennv shell
