You will have to use two different command-line tools, depending if you are working with .doc or .docx format.

For .doc use catdoc:

catdoc foo.doc > foo.txt
For .docx use docx2txt:

docx2txt foo.docx
The latter will produce a file called foo.txt in the same directory as the original.

I'm not sure which Linux distribution you are using, but both catdoc and docx2txt are available from the Ubuntu repositories, for example.
