OK so pandoc isn't techincaly for latex compilation
but md is kinda similar to latex
so, if you ever use md instead of latex 
you can compile it with pandoc

Specifically, `pandapdf blah.md` should work

For more specifics see my skyspace blog on how to compile to HTML
with stylesheets and fancy stuff
