OK I have the basics figured out of how to get rhymes and synonyms for words, but I need to think of an interesting application now, becasue at the moment it isn't too interesting (looks for rhyme & meaning same) but it accepts really bad scores and really bad rhymes, and it isn't too interesting. It could be nice to have it

* get a rhyme for the last word in each sentence (of a poem)
* other things 

just a note, it should probably not really mess with the formatting (right now it discards all formatting)
