Theland
Rand never exactly conformed to the typical image of a sheep.
He certainly didn’t look the part. Most sheep level up to interesting colors very fast, but Rand has stayed plain white and black for many feeding cycles. He has very low health and is old and decrepit and thus very slow.
Rand wants more than anything in theland to taste a Hawaiian pizza before his death
This Hawaiian pizza would greatly increase his happiness, and rejuvenate him

He knew that it would not be easy

It is a long and dangerous journey to reach the pizza
If he was ever to make it he must travel through lands potentially inhabited by dinos and even other tribes of animals

Rand decided to set out

He passed a newly spawned dragon on his way  
It was about to enter into the sight radius of a dino 
once the dino detected the dragon it would have no chance of living
the oblivious dragon continued on its journey towards its doom
for Rand this was a great opportunity
in luring the dino towards the dragon, Rand would have a whole new area of the land to explore for hawaiian pizza
the dragons were not nice
once they gain a little age they often viciously attacked the sheep to which Rand was family
Rationally Rand knew that this was the perfect opportunity
yet somehow taking it felt wrong 
every time he tried to he was tugged back by a repulsive force as if he was attracted to some point controlled by a being in a world that he could never comprehend

A note on the vision of creatures in theland:
These creatures do not “see” as humans do, but rather they know when things are close to them. They will always detect collisions with other animals and some animals can even sense when they are within some proximity range of another animal. Animals may also be attracted to a user defined point or constrained to a certain area of movement. To call this sense “sight” is highly arbitrary, but it helps make the animals more relatable. In other literature, such as Flatland, 2 dimensional sight is investigated. The proximity sensing of animals in theland is not based on visual differences as in other worlds, and is perhaps in most cases more akin to touch or smell than sight, yet that is the label I will most commonly use. This is a product of the animals of theland living in a world very different from our own. It is conceivable that explaining an alien sense to humans could be very challenging and that is similar to what I do here. Not very similar though, because the “sense” of these animals is actually governed by a very simple algorithm. I digress. A lot. Anyways…
