Science Bowl app for buzzers


# questions FOR ME:
  * what is the best way to do this?
  * back end in what?
  * is this a socket io kind of thing or can it be easier than that (all connect to one flask server?)
  * now that I think about it, that sounds very attractive
  * what I could do, is run a flask server on my computer,
  * everyone creates accounts (or just puts in name)
  * and then clicks to buzz in and it says the name
  * and keeps track of score

  * Question: will the school wifi block this? IP address would be kind of weird... might be labelled as insecure...
