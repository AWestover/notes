OK so aparently mac is kinda broken with regards to pygame support ;(
    but it is ok

    I installed miniconda
    and then I can make a virtualenv with ~/miniconda3 's python

    and conda install pygame like
    `conda install -c cogsci pygame`

    [helpful info](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52718921/problems-getting-pygame-to-show-anything-but-a-blank-screen-on-macos-mojave)

  
    this works:
    source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
    python XXX.py
