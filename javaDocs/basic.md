# java

## jars
java -jar jarfilename. jar

## processing
is a nice java library

you should set up an alias for it:
processing

* go to website 
* install
* unzip
* run the file ./processing in it

(or on windows etc get the app)


# android studio
annoying install from website, but it is for making phone apps
warning this thing is big! (a couple of Gigabytes)

takes a while

on linux you need to setup an alias for running the studio.sh file

mine are

andstud
or
android_studio

the file is
/usr/local/android_studio/bin/studio.sh

also note the sdk is installed at ~ I think
